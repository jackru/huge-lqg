Discovered in January of 2013, the Huge-LGQ (Huge Large Quasar Group) is said to be the largest structure in the universe.
The Huge-LQG is a collection of 73 confirmed quasars (a quasar is a very energetic galaxy).
Astronomers discovered that the group of gravitationally bound quasars is so large that it would take over 4 billion years
to traverse from end to end – while traveling at light speed.

It’s so big, that its very existence puts it at odds with Einstein’s Cosmological Principle.
The cosmological principle says that, when looking at the universe from a large enough scale,
it should look the exact same no matter where you are observing from, or where you look.
The Huge-LGQ throws a wrench into that assumption. Researchers are understandably fascinated by the discovery and are eager
to continue their investigations.
